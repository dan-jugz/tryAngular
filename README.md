This webapp is designed to help a user check which type of triangle it is according to the lengths he/she has input.
Irrespective of how big the figures are,the program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.However, when the users values don't pass any of the checks,the program will inform you the dimensions used can't form a triangle

## Behavior Driven Development 
input|Behavior|Output
----|----|------
Input the three lengths in the form|qualify triangle|output triangle type
Input the three lengths in the form|one side is zero|  dosent make a triangle
Input the three lengths in the form|similar inputs|equilateral triangle
Input the three lengths in the form|two iputs equal|isoceles triangle
Input the three lengths in the form|no input equal|scalene triangle
Input the three lengths in the form|dosent qualify triangle|not a triangle
